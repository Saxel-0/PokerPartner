# PokerPartner
A tool designed to give new players the insight of an experienced pro.

## How to Use
### 1. Best Hand Chance
By selecting the number of players in the game as well as the board state starting from post-flop, the chances that you're currently holding the best hand at the table are calculated using:  
` *add math here* `

Also shown are the chances of the turn/river pulling a card that improves your current hand by a significant* degree.

\*(Significant being defined by a card that improves your hands ranking, not including high card)

### 2. Player Profiles
Users can choose to create profiles of players at the table with them, by doing this you can then store players actions over the span of multiple hands, these data points will later be used to help calculate individual bluff chance.

Key elements being:
   * Hole cards if shown
   * Amount bet at each stage of the hand (based on BB amount)
   * Fold/Bluff
   
Personal accounts and cloud storage will eventually be added to allow for saving profiles between sessions.

### 3. Bluff Chance
By using the bet amounts/hand history of each player, as well as the chances of the player having a high tier hand (to be defined later), a rough percentage chance of the potential for a bet to be a bluff is given.

Only Best Hand Chance will be included in the initial build, the rest will be added as the project progresses.
